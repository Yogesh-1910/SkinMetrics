## üìñ About The Project

SkinMetrics is a cutting-edge, cross-platform mobile application that leverages on-device Artificial Intelligence to provide an instant, preliminary analysis of skin lesions. It empowers users by placing a powerful screening tool directly in their hands, encouraging proactive health monitoring. Built with privacy and accessibility as core tenets, all processing is performed offline, ensuring user data never leaves the device.

The application can dynamically switch between three specialized TFLite models to classify images across a spectrum of dermatological conditions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK:** Ensure you have Flutter installed. [Official Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (recommended) with the Flutter extension.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SkinMetrics.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd SkinMetrics
    ```

3.  **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Manual Package Patch**
    The `flutter_tflite` package requires a manual fix to work with modern versions of the Android build system.

    a. **Open the `build.gradle` file** for the package. The path is:
    `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\hosted\pub.dev\flutter_tflite-1.0.1\android\build.gradle`

    b. **Add the `namespace`** inside the `android { ... }` block:
    ```gradle
    android {
        compileSdkVersion 33
        // ADD THIS LINE
        namespace "sq.flutter.tflite" 
        ...
    }
    ```

    c. **Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file** for the package. The path is:
    `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\hosted\pub.dev\flutter_tflite-1.0.1\android\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml`

    d. **Remove the `package` attribute** from the `<manifest>` tag.
    
    Change this:
    ```xml
    <manifest ... package="sq.flutter.tflite">
    ```
    To this:
    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
    ```

4.  **Get Flutter packages**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

5.  **Run the app**
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
